## Overview
In this project, we develop a machine learning model to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine. This is achieved by training the model on a dataset containing various features of the objects. The project demonstrates the complete workflow of a machine learning project, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Installation
- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sayantichy/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
cd rock-vs-mine-prediction
- Create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
-Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
- Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
- Open and execute the notebook:

- Navigate to the rock_vs_mine_prediction.ipynb file and run all the cells to see the complete workflow and results.

## Make predictions:

You can use the trained model to make predictions on new data by running the appropriate cells in the notebook.
